The Python scripts here are used to update, edit, or correct metadata in the DataLad-tracked EF dataset.
+ The scripts are run in terminal in cubic by calling `python {name of script}` and then tracking changes with `datalad save -m "{commit message}"`
  after the script is finished running.
+ These python scripts do not necessarily need to be run in a specific order, but the scripts are ordered in the order in which we ran the scripts on the dataset.
